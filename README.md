# Soil Moisture Analysis Using Earth Observation Data

This project addresses the critical challenge of helping farmers make informed agricultural decisions using soil moisture data from Earth Observation datasets. The tool analyzes soil moisture levels over a given period, detects extreme conditions like droughts or floods, and offers actionable recommendations. It includes a C++ application for data processing and a Python script for visualizing the analysis. By leveraging this tool, farmers can plan irrigation, implement drainage strategies, and make data-driven decisions to improve agricultural productivity.

## Overview
This project utilizes soil moisture data from NASA Earth Observation datasets to identify trends and extreme conditions, providing farmers with valuable insights. By detecting moisture abnormalities such as drought or flood conditions, this tool helps optimize irrigation, reduce crop loss, and promote sustainable water management practices. The project comprises two main components:
1. **C++ Application**: Reads and processes soil moisture data, performs analysis, and identifies potential drought or flood conditions.
2. **Python Script**: Visualizes the processed data, displaying trends over time and highlighting abnormal moisture levels using time-series plots and moving averages.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Computes average soil moisture levels and identifies drought or flood conditions.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual insights into soil moisture trends and abnormalities.
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Offers suggestions based on the detected conditions to help farmers make informed decisions.
- **Flexible Data Input**: Can work with real-world datasets or synthetic data.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- **C++ Compiler** (GCC or Clang)
- **CMake** (Version 3.10 or higher)
- **Python 3.6+** with the following libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/kyadav40/TeamY.git
   cd TeamY
   ```

2. **Install the required Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pandas matplotlib
   ```

### Building the C++ Project
To build the C++ project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a build directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   ```

2. **Run CMake** to configure the project:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

3. **Compile the project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the executable**:
   ```bash
   ./FarmersAid
   ```

### Running the Project
After building the project, ensure that the file `nasa_soil_moisture_data.txt` is in the root directory. Run the application:

```bash
./FarmersAid
```

The program will read the data, perform analysis, and generate a new CSV file (`soil_moisture_output.csv`) containing the processed results.

## Visualizing the Results
To visualize the soil moisture data, use the provided `plot.py` script. It reads the `soil_moisture_output.csv` file generated by the C++ program and creates a time-series plot showing daily soil moisture levels, 7-day moving averages, and drought/flood conditions.

Run the script using:

```bash
python3 plot.py
```

The script will generate a plot and save it as `soil_moisture_analysis.png` in the same directory.

## Sample Output
Below is an example of the generated CSV output:

```
Date,SoilMoisture
2024-09-01,15.2
2024-09-02,18.5
2024-09-03,12.8
...
2024-11-30,35.7
```

The generated plot (`soil_moisture_analysis.png`) will display time-series data for the three months, along with marked regions for drought and flood conditions.
